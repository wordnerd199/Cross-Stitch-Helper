Final project for SDEV 140

This will be my final project for SDEV 140; it is a program intended to calculate how much thread is needed to complete a pattern. I have also uploaded three test pattern files (homesweet.txt, rainbow.txt, and westie.txt) to show the formatting requirements for your own patterns.
